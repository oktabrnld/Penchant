        // Set a seed value for the random number generator
        int seed = 12345;

        // Create a Penchant instance with the specified seed
        PenchantGenerator generator = new PenchantGenerator(seed);

        // Generate a random integer between 0 and 100
        int randomNumber = generator.RandomInt(0, 100);

        Debug.Log("Random Number: " + randomNumber);
    }
}
```
